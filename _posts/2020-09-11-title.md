About Me

I have a proven track record of project and program management. I am a flexible leader with a knack for driving team performance and finding client-focused solutions.

My recent experiences using Agile, Lean, and Design Thinking methodologies have transformed my perspective on projects. I am eager to combine my experience and new skills to identify root problems, ideate solutions, and execute efficiently to create value for all stakeholders.
